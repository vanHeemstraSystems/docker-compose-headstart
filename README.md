# Docker Compose - Headstart

Based on "Get started with Docker Compose" at https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/

On this page you build a simple Python web application running on Docker Compose. The application uses the Flask framework and maintains a hit counter in Redis. While the sample uses Python, the concepts demonstrated here should be understandable even if you’re not familiar with it.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have already installed both [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). You don’t need to install Python or Redis, as both are provided by Docker images.

## Step 1: Setup




## Step 2: Create a Dockerfile





## Step 3: Define services in a Compose file




## Step 4: Build and run your app with Compose





## Step 5: Edit the Compose file to add a bind mount




## Step 6: Re-build and run the app with Compose




## Step 7: Update the application




## Step 8: Experiment with some other commands
